# Gene-Expression-Analysis-App-on-Python-Streamlit
This project is an interactive and user-friendly application using Python and Streamlit, designed for the comprehensive analysis of molecular biology data, with a particular focus on gene expression datasets. The application provides essential analytical tools such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and pattern recognition, clustering (both hierarchical and non-hierarchical) for identifying sample or gene groupings, and volcano plots for visualizing differentially expressed genes based on statistical significance and fold change. It is fully parameterizable, allowing users to customize key aspects of the analysis—such as p-value and fold-change thresholds or clustering distance metrics—and supports various input file formats including .csv, .tsv, and .txt . Files can be uploaded directly through the app interface. To ensure portability and reproducibility across computing environments, the entire application is containerized using Docker, guaranteeing consistent behavior regardless of operating system or local library configurations.
