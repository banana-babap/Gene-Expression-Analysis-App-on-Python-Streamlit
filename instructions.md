Before developing and running the application, it is necessary to install the required Python libraries. These are listed in the requirements.txt file. After writing and testing the code of the app, the next step is to use Docker to containerize it. This makes the app portable and ensures it will run on other devices without compatibility issues, including on smartphones. To do this, open a terminal and enter the following commands. First, build the Docker image using docker build -t biodata-ml-app . (note that the dot at the end of the command is important). Then, run the app with docker run -p 8501:8501 biodata-ml-app (no dot is required in this command). Once these commands are executed, the application will be fully functional and accessible via a web browser at http://localhost:8501(The local host can be found in terminal via 'ipconfig' command and the one that is needed there is IPv4 Address). Users can then upload dataset files in .csv, .tsv, .xlsx, or .txt format for molecular biology analysis using PCA, clustering, volcano plotting, and COVID-19 dataset tools.
